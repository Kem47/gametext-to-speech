# GameText-To-Speech (WIP)

This is a project to provide a text-to-speech functionality for videogames that do not have voiceover and are text-based. Games that fall into this category are CRPGs like recent Pillars of Eternity or old classic Baldurs Gate games. Games like visual novels or point-and-click adventures could also be really good candidates for this tool.


I am a big RPG fan especially of the classic CRPGs. However I recognise that they involve a lot of reading which is not for everyone for various reasons. Some people might find it difficult to read small text for hours on end or have other limitation. Maybe the person is just lazy or too tired and doesn't want to sit and read a novel hours to experience the game. Whatever the reason I want to provide options for gamers so that they can experience these awesome games.


This is still a very much work-in-progress project at an early stage.
